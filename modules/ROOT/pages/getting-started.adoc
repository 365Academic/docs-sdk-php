The Hello Couchbase app shows how to perform some simple database operations.

To get started with the SDK, install it on your computer and then try a simple example, Hello Couchbase.

== Installing the PHP SDK

Installing the PHP SDK is similar to installing most other PHP extensions.
You can install the latest `couchbase` module by using http://pecl.php.net[PECL^] as follows:

[source,bash]
----
$ pecl install couchbase
----

Alternatively, you can manually download a prebuilt version of the library matching your server environment and use that instead.
