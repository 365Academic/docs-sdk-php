= Working with N1QL queries
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
You can perform Couchbase Query Language (N1QL) queries via the PHP SDK.

To send N1QL queries, you must specify a list of application query hosts through the ``enableN1ql()``method (a temporary necessity).
After you have done this, you can perform a N1QL query by using the `query()` method, which accepts a query created through the `CouchbaseN1qlQuery` class.
You receive an array of objects representing the results.

The following example shows how to send a N1QL query:

[source,php]
----
$myBucket = $myCluster->openBucket();
$myBucket->enableN1ql(array('http://1.1.1.1:8093/','http://1.1.1.2:8093/'));
$query = CouchbaseN1qlQuery::fromString('SELECT * FROM default');
$res = $myBucket->query($query);
var_dump($res);
----

Sample output from the example:

[source,javascript]
----
array(2) {
  [0]=>
  array(1) {
    ["field_name"]=>
    string("value1")
  }
  [1]=>
  array(1) {
    ["field_name"]=>
    string("value2")
  }
}
----
