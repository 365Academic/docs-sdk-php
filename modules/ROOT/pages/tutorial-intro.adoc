The PHP SDK tutorial shows you how to build a complete web application that interacts with Couchbase Server.

The PHP SDK tutorial uses a very powerful toolchain consisting of https://getcomposer.org/[Composer^], http://silex.sensiolabs.org/[Silex^] and http://twig.sensiolabs.org/[Twig^] to build a solid web application fast while not losing the focus on showing you how to work with the PHP SDK.

The tutorial uses the `beer-sample` data set that is provided with Couchbase Server to create an app that displays and manages beers and breweries.
Along the way youâ€™ll pick up concepts on querying Couchbase Server by keys or through views.

The full code sample is available on https://github.com/couchbaselabs/beersample-php[GitHub^].
You can clone the repository and work from there if you just want to see the finished application or get started quickly.

Before getting started, make sure you have the following dependencies in place:

* PHP 5.3 or later.
The PHP SDK itself requires PHP 5.3 or later, and most of the other dependencies require PHP 5.3.
* http://www.couchbase.com/develop/php/current[Couchbase PHP SDK 2.0^] : Install the appropriate .so or .dll file, depending on your platform.
Earlier versions of the SDK are not capable enough becauseit uses the new Couchbase Server view-related functionality.
* http://getcomposer.org/[Composer^] : An excellent dependency manager for PHP and supported by major libraries and frameworks such as http://www.doctrine-project.org/[Doctrine^] or http://symfony.com/[Symfony^].
