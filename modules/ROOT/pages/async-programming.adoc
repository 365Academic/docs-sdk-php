= Asynchronous Progamming Using the PHP SDK with Couchbase Server
:navtitle: Asynchronous Programming

The PHP SDK does not support non-blocking operations.
You can nevertheless take advantage of xref:batching-operations.adoc[batching operations] by using the various xref:document-operations.adoc#batching[[.api]`*Multi` operations].
Multi operations send multiple operations at once to the server and wait their response in parallel, allowing quicker response times and batch execution on the server.
