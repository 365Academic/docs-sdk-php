[abstract]
All blocking


The PHP API may be all blocking -- with no asynchronous API, and no streaming (as the streaming libraries do not offer the necessary PHP primitives) -- but this is not necessarily a limitation.
The PHP way is to launch as many processes as necessary.


== Multi Get, Multi Options

The availability of `multi_upsert`

chunks in separate processes;
parallel calls --> batching

== Batching

Bulk loading with multiple PHP processes -- using multi_get to fetch with multiple keys -- provides a useful way of achieving the effectiveness of asynchronous operations.
