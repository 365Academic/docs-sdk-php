= Deleting documents
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
You can delete documents by using the `remove()` method.

This method immediately removes the document from your bucket.

The following example shows how to delete a document:

[source,php]
----
$myBucket = $myCluster->openBucket();
$res = $myBucket->remove('document_name');
var_dump($res);
----

Sample output from the example:

----
object(CouchbaseMetaDoc)#4 (4) {
  ["cas"]=>
  resource(5) of type (CAS)
}
----
