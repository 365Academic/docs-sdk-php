[abstract]
Operations use basic PHP data types.

== Data types

Most PHP data types that can be serialized via the JSON functions are supported by default.
Recursive structures cannot be serialized.
All textual data is represented by UTF-8 when stored to Couchbase Server.
You may alternatively implement your own transcoders which modify the method by which your documents are serialized to Couchbase.
The following is an example of a transcoder which will transcode all documents as UTF-8 encoded JSON documents.

[source,php]
----
$bucket->setTranscoder(function($value) {
  return array(json_encode($value), 0, 0);
}, function($value, $flags, $datatype) {
  return json_decode($value, true);
});
