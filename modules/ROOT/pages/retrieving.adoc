= Retrieving documents
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
You can retrieve documents by using regular reads or replica reads.

== Regular reads

You perform regular reads by using the `get()` method.
Regular reads enable you to retrieve a previously stored document from your active data set.

The following example shows a regular read:

[source,php]
----
$myBucket = $myCluster->openBucket();
$res = $myBucket->get(‘document_name’);
var_dump($res);
----

Sample output from the example:

----
object(CouchbaseMetaDoc)#4 (4) {
  ["value"]=>
  array(1) {
    ["name"]=>
    string(5) "Frank"
  }
  ["flags"]=>
  int(4)
  ["cas"]=>
  resource(5) of type (CAS)
}
----

== Replica reads

You perform replica reads by using the `getReplica()` method.
Replica reads enable you to retrieve a previously stored document by querying the replica copies of this document rather than the active one.
This is not guaranteed to be consistent, but does permit a level of recovery in case the primary server is not reachable.
