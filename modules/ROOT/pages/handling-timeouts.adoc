= Handling timeouts
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
Timeouts occur when an operation that was performed is not able to be processed fast enough.

Timeouts can occur due to connection issues to the appropriate Couchbase Server node, or due to high server loads.
Internally, the SDK will attempt to retry an operation internally upon recoverable failures such as timeouts.
However, if there is a persistent issue, a timeout will be emitted to the client, when this occurs it is suggested that you push this error back upon request initiator (the frontend) and be attempted at some later date.

NOTE: If a Timeout error is received by the client for an operation, it is not recommended that the operation is retried immediately.
Instead, in the general case, any attempt to retry should be issued after a period defined by an exponential backoff and maximum retries threshold.
