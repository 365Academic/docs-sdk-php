Follow the guidelines to better use the resources.

Though the PHP SDK and Couchbase Server are extremely performant, follow these guidelines to ensure the most effective use of your computing resources:

[#ol_abl_mwq_t4]
* Couchbase bucket connections are relatively expensive to establish in relation to the operations performed on them.
Because of this, you should open each bucket only once per application instance.
Due to multiplexing performed within the SDK, opening multiple connections can cause issues and will not benefit performance in most cases.
* Don't use too many views and buckets.
A large number of buckets or views can negatively affect the performance of Couchbase Server and any connected clients.
